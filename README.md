## EDMC-EDIRL

EDIRL is a plugin for EDMC, allowing the Elite Dangerous Market Connector to notify explorers when the systems where they are located exist in the 21st century databases of planet Earth.
If the system belongs to the fictional world of Elite Dangerous, the plugin will display 'No data found', while the name of the system will be displayed and clickable if it is found in the list of systems currently known to humans.
